## 1. Introduction

Today, the Internet enables the movement of data (videos, text, photos and more) globally in milliseconds. But try moving value (money, loyalty points etc.) and you will be surprised by the costs, inefficiencies and time delays.

Blockchain is a revolutionary technology that enables "internets of value" that can move value in seconds - money, loyalty points, equity shares, bonds, coupons, votes, intellectual property and much more.

Blockchain is a world-changing technology, but it suffers from some pain points:

1.	Installing, configuring, securing, troubleshooting, updating, and maintaining a blockchain ecosystem is a complex and time consuming task.
2.	There are 100+ blockchains and distributed ledger systems to choose from
3.	Building blockchain solutions from the ground up is very expensive and time consuming.
4. There is a severe shortage of skilled blockchain developers.
 
Primechain APIs make it very simple for developers to add blockchain power to their code - smart asset lifecycle management, electronic signatures, encrypted data storage & more.

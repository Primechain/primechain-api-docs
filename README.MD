# 1. Introduction

Today, the Internet enables the movement of data (videos, text, photos and more) globally in milliseconds. But try moving value (money, loyalty points etc.) and you will be surprised by the costs, inefficiencies and time delays.

Blockchain is a revolutionary technology that enables "internets of value" that can move value in seconds - money, loyalty points, equity shares, bonds, coupons, votes, intellectual property and much more.

## 1.1 Blockchain benefits

1. Blockchain removes the characteristic of infinite reproducibility from a digital asset. It confirms that each unit of value was transferred only once, solving the long-standing problem of double spending.

2. A single blockchain transaction can perform multiple asset exchanges between two or more parties. The exchange takes place in a single transaction, and comes with a guarantee of atomicity aka delivery-versus-payment, meaning that all of the asset transfers take place simultaneously, or none take place at all. This enabled real-time automated settlement and removes the need for reconciliation.

3. A blockchain can assign title rights because it provides a record that compels offer and acceptance.

4. By storing data across its network, a blockchain eliminates the risks that come with data being held centrally. 

5. The use of public key cryptography, symmetric cryptography and cryptographic hash functions makes blockchains cryptographically secure and provably immutable.

6. Blockchains improves client satisfaction through faster, more convenient and secure services.

7. Blockchains maximizes efficiency, security & transparency and minimizes fraud.

8. Blockchains accelerates information and money flows.

9. Blockchains greatly improve auditability and streamlines paperwork.

## 1.2 Blockchain pain points

Blockchain is a world-changing technology, but it suffers from some pain points:

1.	Installing, configuring, securing, troubleshooting, updating, and maintaining a blockchain ecosystem is a complex and time consuming task.

2.	There are 100+ blockchains and distributed ledger systems to choose from.

3.	Building blockchain solutions from the ground up is very expensive and time consuming.

4. There is a severe shortage of skilled blockchain developers.

## 1.3 Primechain API

Primechain APIs are RESTful JSON APIs for interacting with blockchains that allow developers to add blockchain power to their solutions in minutes.

This is what happens:   

### Step 1: Hash computation
The SHA-512 hash of the data is computed.

### Step 2: Signing
The hash is signed using the private key of the signer, using the secp256k1 algorithm.

### Step 3: Encrypting the data
The data is encrypted using the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm and the following are generated: 
1. the encrypted version of the data
2. the AES password
3. the Initialization Vector (IV). Initialization Vector is a nonce that is associated with an invocation of authenticated encryption on a particular plaintext and Additional Authenticated Data (AAD).   
4. the Authentication Tag (tag), which is a cryptographic checksum on data that is designed to reveal both accidental errors and the intentional modification of the data.

### Step 4: Storing the encrypted data
The encrypted data and the tag are published to the blockchain.

### Step 5: Output 
The following is the output:
1. the relevant Sawtooth transaction id
2. the digital signature
3. the AES password
4. the Initialization Vector (IV)

***Sample output***
```

"aes_iv": "RaaizYEJvqxg"
}
}
```

## 7. Decrypt, verify and retrieve data from the blockchain
To retrieve data from the blockchain, use `post /api/v1/decrypt_download_data_sawtooth` and pass these values:
1. the relevant Sawtooth transaction id 
2. the sawtooth public key of the signer
3. the AES password
4. the Initialization Vector (IV)
5. the digital signature

***Sample input***
```

"aes_password": "gkSQEaVPI9bHwGM37NmtjNBUad7mwoHm",
"aes_iv": "RaaizYEJvqxg"
}
```
This is what happens:   

### Step 1: Retrieval of encrypted data 
The encrypted data and tag are retrieved from the blockchain.

### Step 2: Decryption
The encrypted data is decrypted.

### Step 3: Verification
The digital signature is verified.

### Step 4: Output
The output will be the data if the signature is verified and valid.

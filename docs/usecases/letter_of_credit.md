A letter of credit is like a promissory note that represents an obligation taken on by a bank to make a payment once certain criteria are met - once the terms are completed and confirmed, the bank will transfer the funds. Simply put, a letter of credit ensures that the payment will be made as long as the services are performed.

***Example:*** An Indian exporter receives an order from an American importer. The exporter is not sure about the importer’s ability and willingness to pay once the order is delivered. The exporter requests for a letter of credit from the importer. The importer then applies for a letter of credit from its bank (where it has adequate funds or credit line). Once the goods are shipped, the bank pays the exporter subject to fulfilment of relevant terms and conditions. 

Letters of credit are especially important in international trade due to the distance involved and potentially differing laws in the countries of the businesses involved. In these transactions, it is not always possible for the parties to meet in person. The bank issuing the letter of credit holds payment on behalf of the buyer until it receives confirmation that the goods in the transaction have been shipped. (Source: Investopedia)

# Step 1: Agreement to purchase goods
The buyer agrees to purchase goods from the seller. This agreement may be a purchase order, an accepted pro-forma invoice, a formal contract, or an informal exchange of messages. Agreement is made as to goods being purchased, how and when they are to be shipped and insured, and how and when payment is to be effected. In this case, the agreement is to use a letter of credit as the mechanism of payment.

Step 2 The buyer applies to his bank for a letter of credit, by signing the bank's letter of credit application/agreement form.

Step 3 After approving the application, the issuing bank issues the actual letter of credit instrument and sends it to the seller (beneficiary).

Step 4 Having received the issuing bank's assurance of payment, the seller ships the goods to the buyer.

Step 5 The seller prepares the documents called for in the letter of credit and presents them to the issuing bank.

Step 6 The issuing bank examines the documents. If it determines that the documents comply with the letter of credit, the issuing bank pays the seller.

Steps 7 & 8 The issuing bank obtains payment from the applicant (buyer) in accordance with the terms of the applicant?s letter of credit agreement and forwards the documents to the applicant.

Step 9 The applicant uses the documents to pick up the merchandise from the carrier, completing the letter of credit cycle.

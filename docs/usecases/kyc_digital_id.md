Financial and capital markets use the KYC (Know Your Customer) system to identify "bad" customers and minimize money laundering, tax evasion and terrorism financing. Efforts to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism are costing the financial sector billions of dollars. Banks are also exposed to huge penalties for failure to follow KYC guidelines. Costs aside, KYC can delay transactions and lead to duplication of effort between banks.

TRADE-Chain provides a robust immutable platform for real-time KYC & Digital Identity verification.

# 1. Introduction

According to an independent survey discussing the real impact of global changes in Know Your Customer (KYC) regulation on corporates by Refinitiv:

#### 1. The KYC burden on corporates is being magnified by their high number of banking relationships.
* On average globally, each corporate has 10 banking relationships.
* Bigger organizations have more banking relationships, as many as 14 in some cases.

#### 2. Financial institutions’ lack of common KYC standards continues to create issues for corporates.
* 85% of corporates have not had a good KYC experience.
* 12% changed banks as a result.

#### 3. KYC procedures continue to lengthen client onboarding times.
* Average onboarding times have risen from 28 days in 2016 to 32 days in 2017.
* Corporates are contacted an average of 8 times by banks during the onboarding process

#### 4. Corporates are still not passing on all material changes.
* 30% have not made their banks aware of all material changes.
* The average time corporates spend updating their FIs about material changes has risen to 30 days, up from 27 days in 2016.

#### 5. The regulatory pressure on banks is being passed down to corporates by increasing the volume of KYC information required.
* Half of all respondents say that changes to regulatory requirements are driving the amount of time they spend on KYC.
* On average, corporates spend 26 days a year supplying additional regulatory information, up from 23 days in 2016.

#### 6. Verification is not portable since the documents needed vary from nation to nation and bank to bank. 

# 2. Statistics

* Some major financial institutions spend up to $500 million annually on KYC and customer due diligence.

* 10% of the world’s top financial institutions spend at least $100 million annually on it.

* Average annual spending (including labor and third-party costs) is $48 million.

* KYC is driving up the costs of customer onboarding. 2017 saw a 19% increase compared to 2016, with a 16% increase expected in 2018.

* More than half of all banking salespeople are spending one-and-a-half days each week onboarding new client organizations.

* A few years ago, Citibank said about half its $3.4 billion efficiency savings were “consumed by additional investments that we’re making in regulatory and compliance activities.”

* In 2013, JPMorgan added 5,000 employees to their compliance team and spent an additional $1 billion on controls.

* Risk, governance and compliance costs account for 15-20% of the total “run the bank” cost base of most major banks (Bain & Co.)

# 3. The solution

Primechain-KYC is a blockchain API for corporate and individual KYC, due-diligence and charge registry. Primechain-KYC records are stored in the blockchain in an encrypted form and the decryption credentials are available only to the uploading entity. 

This ensures data privacy and confidentiality while at the same time ensuring that records are shared only between banks that trust each other. Primechain-KYC can be used intra-bank and inter-bank (nationally / globally).

Some of the benefits of Primechain-KYC:

1. Removes duplication of effort, automates processes and reduces compliance errors.

2. Enables the distribution of encrypted updates to client information in real time.

3. Provides the historical record of all compliance activities undertaken for each customer.

4. Provides the historical record of all documents pertaining to each customer.

5. Records can be used as evidence to prove to regulators that the bank has complied with all relevant regulations.

6. Enables identification of entities attempting to create fraudulent histories.

7, Enables data and records to be analyzed to spot criminal activities.


## 3.1 Issue KYC and Digital Identity records

To encrypt, sign and publish KYC records on TRADE-Chain, use `post /api/v1/publish_data` and pass 4 parameters: 
1. `primechain_address` - the primechain address of the signer.
2. `keys` - upto 5 keys can be used to enable quick searching of the data. Each key can be upto 256 characters including blank spaces. Recommended keys are: 
   * Full name of the customer
   * Income tax registration number of the customer
   * Country of citizenship of the customer
   * Name of bank issuing the record
   * Date as of which the record is current
   
3. `data` - the data. 
4. `trade_channel_name` - as kyc.

Lets take an example of Gopal Kumar Santoshi, a citizen of Zimblia having income tax registration number 235465657887565. This sample record is being published by Global Bank and is current as of 19-January-2019.
```
{
  "primechain_address": "1VUid7fZaiFnNXddiwfwvk8idyXixkFKRSQvMp",
   "keys": 
    [
      "Gopal Kumar Santoshi",
      "235465657887565",
      "Zimblia",
      "Global Bank",
      "19-January-2019"
    ],
   "data": 
    {
      "name": "Gopal Kumar Santoshi",
      "name_of_father": "Hari Kumar Santoshi",
      "name_of_wife": "Ekta Santoshi",
      "email": "gopal@example.com",
      "mobile": "+91-1234567890",
      "address": "213, Zimblia Avenue, Zimblia",
      "gender": "male",
      "date_of_birth": "06-NOV-1973",
      "driving_license": "0987654321 dated 11-JAN-2010 issued by RTO, Zimblia",
      "passport": "6554345678 dated 18-MAR-2010 issued by PPO, Zimblia"
    }, 
   "trade_channel_name": "kyc"
}
```

***This is what happens:***   
1. The SHA-512 hash of the data is computed.
2. The hash is signed using the private key of the provided primechain address (using ECDSA).
3. The digital signature, hash and the primechain address of the signer are stored in the trade channel.
4. The data is encrypted using the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm and the following are generated: 
    * the encrypted version of the data    
    * the AES password    
    * the Initialization Vector (IV)    
    * the Authentication Tag (tag)   
5. The encrypted data and the tag are published to the specified trade channel.

***The following is the output:***
1. `tx_id_enc_data` - the id of the transaction in which the encrypted data and tag were published to the trade channel.
2. `tx_id_signature` - the id of the transaction in which the digital signature, hash and the signer's primechain address were published to the the trade channel.
3. `signature` - the digital signature
4. `aes_password` - the AES password
5. `aes_iv` - the Initialization Vector (IV)
6. `trade_channel_name` - the name of the trade channel to which the data is published.

    }
}
```
## 3.2 Search for records by key

To search for records by key, use `post /api/v1/list_trade_channel_items_by_key` and pass 2 parameters:
1. `key` - the income tax registration number 
2. `trade_channel_name` as kyc

Sample input
```
{
  "key": "235465657887565",
  "trade_channel_name": "kyc"

## 3.4 Retrieve KYC and Digital Identity records
To retrieve data use `post /api/v1/get_data` and pass 5 parameters:
1. `tx_id_enc_data` - the id of the transaction in which the encrypted data and tag were published to the trade channel.
2. `tx_id_signature` - the id of the transaction in which the digital signature, hash and the signer's primechain address were published to the trade channel.
3. `aes_password` - the AES password.
4. `aes_iv` - the Initialization Vector (IV).
5. `trade_channel_name` - the name of the trade channel from which the data is to be retrieved.

Sample input
```
{
  "tx_id_enc_data": "a5e3ff1e5d0e1b90098216e3e246bbea512adcb5413e1517dd25b86718a37a0e",

  "aes_iv": "YNxSvgWm2uVK",
  "trade_channel_name": "kyc"
}
```
***This is what happens:***   
1. The digital signature, hash and the primechain address of the signing entity are retrieved from the trade channel.
2. The encrypted data and tag are retrieved from the trade channel.
3. The encrypted data is decrypted.
4. The digital signature is verified.

***The following is the output:***
1. `data` - the unencrypted data.   
2. `primechain_address` - the primechain address of the signer.   
3. `signature_status` - the verification status of the signature.  
4. `timestamp` - the timestamp

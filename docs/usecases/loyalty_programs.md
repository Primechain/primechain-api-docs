# Loyalty program lifecycle management

A loyalty program is a structured marketing strategy designed to encourage customers to continue to purchase goods or services of associated merchants.
One of the biggest problems with legacy loyalty programs are low redemption rates. Members who do not redeem are not actively engaged in the loyalty program. Members who redeem points are more engaged, spend more and are more satisfied with loyalty programs.

***Benefits of using a shared blockchain for loyalty programs:***
1. Enable customers to store all points in a single digital wallet rather than forcing the customer to manage multiple programs. 
2. Enable customers to receive and redeem loyalty points in real-time 
3. Create broader opportunities for local campaigns, partner offers, and targeted content.
4. Reduce fraud.
5. Reduce cost of loyalty program lifecycle management.
6. Improve customer experience.

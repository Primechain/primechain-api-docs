# Know Your Customer (KYC)

Financial and capital markets use the KYC (Know Your Customer) system to identify "bad" customers and minimise money laundering, tax evasion and terrorism financing. Efforts to prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism are costing the financial sector billions of dollars. Banks are also exposed to huge penalties for failure to follow KYC guidelines. 

Costs aside, KYC can delay transactions and lead to duplication of effort between banks. Blockchain provides a secure platform for high-quality, validated KYC & due diligence information on individuals and corporates. All information is provided by banks in an encrypted format. Members may list a price for each record and may choose to share / sell the information to selected Bankchain members. 

***Primechain API can be used to create a transparent, secure and efficient sharing / monetization blockchain for 
high-quality, validated KYC & due diligence information on individuals.***

The blockchain nodes can be operated by Banks, Financial institutions and Regulators.

## 1. Sign, encrypt and store KYC data in the blockchain

To sign, encrypt and store KYC data in the blockchain, use [`encrypt_sign_store_data`](https://github.com/Primechain/primechain-api-docs/blob/master/docs/Encrypted%20data%20storage.MD#2-sign-encrypt-and-store-data-in-the-blockchain)

Sample input:
```
{
  "primechain_address": "1N9VtvZvP3rsw5Rf4Qpi12TWBaDoEwM2BAEsv2",
  "data": 
  {
    "data_category": "KYC",
    "entity_category": "INDIVIDUAL",
    "name": "Gopal Kumar Santoshi",
    "name_father": "INDIVIDUAL",
    "name_wife": "Ekta Santoshi",
    "email": "gopal@example.com",
    "mobile": "+91-1234567890",
    "address": "213, Zimblia Avenue, Zimblia, IN",
    "gender": "male",
    "dob": "06-NOV-1973",
    "driving_license": "0987654321 dated 11-JAN-2010 issued by RTO, Zimblia",
    "passport": "6554345678 dated 18-MAR-2010 issued by PPO, Zimblia"
  }
}
```
Sample output:
```
{
"status": 200,
"response": 
  {
    "tx_id_enc_data": "2f8b38c13db74e9a6f57edbd504f94fa9fd4138c3b0a68218f7bb83ad49848a9",
    "tx_id_signature": "e6bab35b15d91d02659fdfaebc96d50a6d76f7c4e620ba2ef662d78306ce1d15",
    "signature": "Hxc55xzUa4z/3/PoPTbWgOU0MCk+8Bne6Y65nkA4QOsueIR6HlRE0qlYUSpxwVEVuDn4E/VbgwWBCIknXB+f+EI=",
    "aes_password": "kTQCgp1AUvdjm1lMHe6vwN1zi3EthtKK",
    "aes_iv": "2F3FnHkHHd0R"
  }
}
```
Save this output in your private database along with the following:
* Customers identifier
* Price (optional)
* Description of the record

## 2. Decrypt, verify and retrieve KYC data from the blockchain
To decrypt, verify and retrieve KYC data in the blockchain, use [`decrypt_download_data`](https://github.com/Primechain/primechain-api-docs/blob/master/docs/Encrypted%20data%20storage.MD#3-decrypt-verify-and-retrieve-data-from-the-blockchain)

Sample input:

  "aes_password": "kTQCgp1AUvdjm1lMHe6vwN1zi3EthtKK",
  "aes_iv": "2F3FnHkHHd0R"
  }
```
Sample output:
```

      },
    "signer_detail":

***The pain points of today’s trade finance processes are:***
1. Delays and errors due to manual document creation and distribution
2. Invoice factoring risk
3. Delayed timeline
4. Manual AML review
5. Fraud risk due to multiple disconnected platforms
6. Fraud risk due to duplicate bills of lading

***Core benefits of TRADE-Chain:***
1. Real-time review and approval of documents.
2. Real-time, transparent view of invoices for discounting and factoring.
3. Eliminating the need for correspondent banks and other intermediaries.
4. Elimination of fraud by providing real-time, transparent view of bills of lading.
5. Transparency in terms of ownership and location of goods.
6. Real-time, automated settlements without the need for reconciliation.
7. Real-time view to regulators leading to complete regulatory transparency.
8. Reducing the letter of credit issue process from several days to a few hours.
9. Reducing the time of delivery for trade documents from several days to a few hours.
10.Increased transparency by sharing transaction details with all parties.

## 1. Introduction and overview

TRADE-Chain is a permissioned multi-framework blockchain powered by Primechain APIs. TRADE-Chain nodes are available to banks, financial institutions and large exporters, importers, shippers and investors.

### 1.1 Sandbox blockchain
To access the TRADE-Chain sandbox, email us on info@primechain.in

### 1.2 Production blockchain
Nodes on the commpercial / production TRADE-Chain are available free to all Bankchain members and at an annual subscription fee for non-members. Email us on info@primechain.in for details.

### 1.3 System requirements
2 virtual machines / physical servers with the following details are required:
* Ubuntu 16.04 machine with 32 GB RAM, 4 core processor, 100 GB SSD disk). The following ports are required to be open: 22. 15590 and 61172.   
* For the TRADE-Chain API server: Ubuntu 16.04 machine with 32 GB RAM, 8 core processor, 25 GB SSD disk). The following ports are required to be open: 22 and 2512.

### 1.4 Information Security issues
* Symmetric and asymmetric cryptography ensures confidentiality of data.   
* Hash functions ensure integrity of data.   
* Multiple blockchain nodes ensure availability of data.   
* Blockchain technology ensures provable immutability of data.   
* Digital signatures ensure non-repudiation.   
* [Blockchain Security Controls](http://www.primechaintech.com/bsc.php) provide the security controls and information security framework.

### 1.5 API keys
API keys authenticate access to the TRADE-Chain API service. To generate an API key, use `get api/v1/get_api_key`. An API key must be passed in the authorization header. ([See example](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/c3e402907d4735fa944e79888ddc58209247e07e/687474703a2f2f7777772e7072696d65636861696e746563682e636f6d2f696d672f6170695f646f63756d656e746174696f6e2f6170695f6b65792e6a7067))

Sample API key
```

```

## 2. Create a dedicated Data Stream
A data stream enables TRADE-Chain to be used as a general purpose append-only database, with TRADE-Chain providing timestamping, notarization and immutability. Storing all the data relating to a transaction, shipment or event in a dedicated data stream enables quick and efficient data retrieval and processing.

To create a new data stream use `post /api/v1/create_data_stream` and provide these 4 parameters:
1. Your node's default primechain address - `primechain_address`
2. The stream name - `stream_name`
3. A short description of the data stream - `details`
4. Whether the stream is open or not - `open`. If open is set to true, write permissions need not be explicitly provided. All addresses can write to the stream. If open is set to false, write permissions need to be explicitly provided. It is recommended to keep the stream as closed and to provide write permissions on an address basis. 

Sample input
```
{
  "primechain_address": "1VUid7fZaiFnNXddiwfwvk8idyXixkFKRSQvMp",
  "stream_name": "200_tons_xyz_Jan_2019",
  "details": "This stream is for the consignment of 200 tons of xyz material",
  "open":false
}
```
The output is the transaction id of the transaction creating the stream - `tx_id`.
Sample output
```
{
"status": 200,
"tx_id": "d84f84849431d5a5c5565530021d4c8bc37bf7180c58a116bd42295f90b434e2"
}
```

## 3. On-board users

To on-board relevant exporters, importers, shippers etc. use `get /api/v1/create_entity_rsa`. The output will be:
1. the primechain address, 
2. primechain private key
3. primechain public key, 
4. RSA private key
5. RSA public key

Sample output
```

## 4. Publish data to a Data Stream

To encrypt, sign anf publish data to a Data Stream, use `post /api/v1/publish_data` and pass 5 parameters: 
1. the private key of the signer - `primechain_private_key`
2. the primechain address of the signer - `primechain_address`
3. The keys to enable quick searching of the data - `keys`
4. the data - `data`
5. the name of the data stream - `stream_name`

Sample input
```
{
  "primechain_private_key": "VHpUJD5NkTrurFHEoQ79t55TUAgZYEFvygbZHSCJ3za6zSwtXbQqVsaV",
  "primechain_address": "1BiWh3dEMEDVRHNTsrYf7MCHHfXP2qL6or34PP",

    ],
   "data": "This is the data that will be encryptd and stored.",
   "stream_name": "200_tons_xyz_Jan_2019"
}
```
***This is what happens:***   
1. The SHA-512 hash of the data is computed.
2. The hash is signed using the provided private key (using ECDSA).
3. The digital signature, hash and the primechain address of the signer are stored in the data stream.
4. The data is encrypted using the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm and the following are generated: the encrypted version of the data, the AES password, the Initialization Vector (IV) and the Authentication Tag (tag).
5. The encrypted data and the tag are published to the data stream.

***The following is the output:***
1. the id of the transaction in which the encrypted data and tag were published to the data stream.
2. the id of the transaction in which the digital signature, hash and the signer's primechain address were published to the the data stream.
3. the digital signature
4. The AES password
5. The Initialization Vector (IV)

## 5. Retrieve data from the blockchain
To retrieve data use `post /api/v1/get_data` and pass 4 parameters:
1. the id of the transaction in which the encrypted data and tag were published to the data stream
2. the id of the transaction in which the digital signature, hash and the signer's primechain address were published to the data stream
3. the AES password
4. the Initialization Vector (IV)
5. the name of the data stream

Sample input
```
{
  "tx_id_enc_data": "16346d48deea43865a276b5153fec90ac2ef83f146a20bf6826df995acdc5fc8",
  "tx_id_signature": "7c72b8fc633d9a091e878ef6c610e4383ca597f846092a35077374fb0accea76",
  "aes_password": "kfkNhEWZErbMLhtKkg6zSTy85Aq9QIJr",
  "aes_iv": "9UuZX4vgZ8r3",
  "stream_name": "200_tons_xyz_Jan_2019"
}
```
***This is what happens:***   
1. The digital signature, hash and the primechain address of the signing entity are retrieved from the data stream.
2. The encrypted data and tag are retrieved from the data stream.
3. The encrypted data is decrypted.
4. The digital signature is verified.

***The following is the output:***
1. the unencrypted data - `data`
2. the primechain address of the signer - `primechain_address`
3. the verification status of the signature - `signature_status`

Sample output
```
{
  "status": 200,
  "response": 
    {
      "data": "This is the data that will be encryptd and stored.",
      "signer_detail": 
        {
          "primechain_address": "1BiWh3dEMEDVRHNTsrYf7MCHHfXP2qL6or34PP"
         },
      "signature_status": true
      }
}
```

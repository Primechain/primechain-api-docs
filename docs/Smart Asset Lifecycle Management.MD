# Smart Asset Lifecycle Management

A blockchain smart asset can be the digital representation of a real-world asset (e.g. gold, equity shares, fiat currency, stressed asset) or an asset in itself (e.g. bitcoin and other crypto-currencies). The blockchain removes the characteristic of infinite reproducibility from a digital asset. It confirms that each unit of value was transferred only once, solving the long-standing problem of double spending. A blockchain can assign title rights because it provides a record that compels offer and acceptance.

## 1. Create a new asset
To create a new smart asset, use `post /api/v1/create_asset`.

***Note:***
*  This may take upto 30 seconds.   
* `from_address` is the entity that creates the asset. It must have `send`, `receive` and `issue` permissions. It must also have permissions to write to the ***ASSET_DATA_MASTERLIST***   
* `to_address` is the entity that receives the newly created asset. It must have `receive` permission and ideally also `send` permission.   
*  The `from_address` and `to_address` can be the same.
*  `unit` refers to the minimum divisible quantity of the asset.
* `asset` refers to the name of the asset.
* `quantity` refers to the initial quantity of the asset.
* `details` refers to any details about the asset.
* Setting `"open": "true"` will create an open asset - additional units of the asset CAN be issued in the future. 
* Setting `"open": "false"` will create a closed asset - additional units of the asset CANNOT be issued in the future. 

```
{
  "from_address": "1K2MYAXp1tiMEKw2VKMrzy8X9peZFrrUbvZnXK",
  "to_address": "4NM46pESGpnvCn8pJmVZpuFepaeUkwKF3YecSM",
  "asset": 
  	{
    	"name": "SILVER-tokens-series-A",
    	"open": false
  	},
  "unit": 1,
  "quantity": 19500,
  "details": "Backed by silver jewellery held in Lot A at Zimblia office" 
}

```
***Output is:***
* the txid of the transaction in which the asset was created.
* the reference number of the asset.
* the newly created data stream specifically for writing data relating to this asset. The `to_address` is granted write permissions to this stream. 
```
{
"status": 200,
"tx_id": "00897558db1f7d2b4682ca79afd1830d5066266bc0118bbe87c7e2ff3a9cc5e1",
"asset_ref": "1074-267-61526",
"description": {
"details": "Backed by silver jewellery held in Lot A at Zimblia office"
}
}
```

## 2. Create additional units of an open asset

To create additional units of an open asset, use `post /api/v1/create_more_asset`.

***Note:***
* `from_address` is the entity that creates the asset. It must have `send` permission.
* `to_address` is the entity that receives the newly created asset. It must have `receive` permission.
* The `from_address` and `to_address` can be the same.
* `asset_name` refers to the name of the asset.
* `quantity` refers to the additional quantity of the asset being issued.
```
{
  "from_address": "1K2MYAXp1tiMEKw2VKMrzy8X9peZFrrUbvZnXK",
  "to_address": "4NM46pESGpnvCn8pJmVZpuFepaeUkwKF3YecSM",
  "asset_name": "SILVER-tokens-series-B",
  "quantity": 5000
}
```
```
{
"status": 200,
"tx_id": "c749efc4cca56b72749e8e2d0acf7bf6282383255482894c578e4c82869fbc4f"
}
```
Output is the id of the transaction in which the additional units were created.

## 3. Details of a specified asset
To get details of a specific asset, use `post /api/v1/asset_details` and pass the asset name or referece id as a parameter.
```
{
  "asset_name": "AUTH-tokens-series-A"
}
```
Output:
